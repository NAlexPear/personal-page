SUMMARY
A recent transplant to St. Louis by way of Nashville, Minneapolis, and Cedar Rapids, IA. I’m looking to take the experience I’ve gained running my own venture in Tennessee and apply it to the St. Louis start-up scene. I’d rather be over-worked on an interesting project than under-worked in a cubicle.


 EDUCATION
St. Olaf College — B.A., 2011
Majors: Economics, Political Science
Concentration: Statistics
Languages: Spanish, Attic Greek



EXPERIENCE


Head of Operations, Claim Academy
St. Louis, MO — November 2014- present
Upon arriving in St. Louis, I started work on a new project called Claim Academy. It’s a bootcamp-style training environment for programmers, coders, and technical co-founders in the St. Louis area. While there are many accomplished programmers employed at established businesses in the area, the market for entry-level programmers willing to work with start-ups and entrepreneurs is non-existent. We’re going to fix that. My responsibilities include hiring instructors, working with instructors to establish a consistently high-quality curriculum, and managing all aspects of the business critical to the success of each class.
Accomplishments
Started Claim Academy from scratch, with our first classes starting in January 2015 after two months of work.




Founder, CEO, and Head Coach, Shackle Island CrossFit & Weightlifting
Hendersonville, TN — October 2011- October 2014
After graduating from college, I co-founded Shackle Island CrossFit and Weightlifting with two business partners. SICF is a top-of-the-line training facility offering classes in recreational and competitive CrossFit and Olympic Weightlifting. My responsibilities as CEO and Head Coach included: creating and implementing training programs for athletes, managing personnel, purchasing and maintaining equipment and supplies, establishing and maintaining a strong social media presence, leading marketing and outreach efforts, creating and hosting competitions and seminars for members and guests, maintaining our websites, and anything else that needed to be done to make the business flourish. Shackle Island CrossFit and Weightlifting is still going strong under new management. 
Accomplishments
Built SICF from 0 clients to 150 clients in 3 years
Designed and implemented new programs and classes in General Fitness, CrossFit, Kids’ CrossFit, Competitive Fitness, Beginners’ Weightlifting, Competitive Weightlifting
Managed a staff of 7 part-time Coaches
Created, promoted, and managed multiple weightlifting meets of over 50 competitors and 100s of spectators, including the largest weightlifting meet ever held in Nashville. 
Oversaw SICFs move from its original 5000 sq-ft industrial warehouse to its current 7200 sq-ft commercial location. 




Assistant Manager and Sales Rep, Vector Marketing
Sioux City, IA — June 2011- October 2011
During the Summer of 2011, I was an assistant manager and sales rep in the Sioux City, IA branch of Vector Marketing. Vector is a direct sales company that sells Cutco cutlery and kitchen products. My responsibilities included selling products, training potential sales reps, hiring and firing reps, managing sales numbers, team-building, and office management. 
Accomplishments
Broke the Midwest divisions sales record for assistant managers in my first 10 days by selling over $13,000 in Cutco products.
Interviewed, trained, and mentored 35 sales reps
Helped the Sioux City branch become the top-performing new Iowa branch for the summer of 2011


Public Relations Officer, Lion’s Pause
Northfield, MN — August 2010- May 2011
The Lion’s Pause is a student-run night club and kitchen for students of St. Olaf College. It was my responsibility to promote events, kitchen specials, and the nightclub in general. Promotion was accomplished through digital, social, and physical media, promotional events, and by ensuring the quality of all events. 
Accomplishments
Successfully hosted the largest single event in Lion’s Pause history (over 1500 in attendance).
2011 was the top-grossing year ever for kitchen sales
2011 had the highest event attendance of any year



President, DreamBox
Northfield, MN — December 2009- May 2011
While attending St. Olaf College, I founded a small non-profit company that connected music students on campus with K-12 music students in the Northfield area in exchange for student work hours. My responsibilities including raising and managing funds, connecting students in Northfield to St. Olaf instructors, and promoting the program and music instruction in general to St. Olaf and Northfield students.
Accomplishments
Awarded $2500 in a business-plan contest awarded by the St. Olaf Center for Entrepreneurship
Connected students to student-teachers for over 100hrs of instruction in a variety of instruments
Provided St. Olaf music students with over $10,000 in student work compensation.


Tour Guide, St. Olaf College Admissions
Northfield, MN — August 2007- May 2011
While attending St. Olaf as a student, I worked for the Admissions department as a part of my student work obligations. It was my responsibility to schedule and lead tours of the campus for prospective students and their families. Tour groups ranged in size from 2 people to up to 10 on one tour.
Accomplishments
Had the highest number of positive ratings from prospective students among all tour guides for 2010, and second-highest in 2009,
Had the highest conversion rate among all tour guides for 2010 (i.e. I had the highest percentage of my prospective students eventually attend St. Olaf)
