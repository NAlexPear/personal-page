title: Blog Tech 1
author: Alex
date: 2014-12-03</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="blog-tech-pt-1">Blog Tech pt.1</h2>
<h3 id="-a-quick-look-at-the-tools-i-ve-used-to-build-this-blog">...a quick look at the tools I&#39;ve used to build this blog</h3>
<p>While most of my posts will deal with more abstract &quot;builds&quot; (businesses, processes, campaigns),
this one is more of a how-to on building a blog like this one. This blog is not a WordPress or Drupal site.
Those CMSes are nice, as long as you like managing a server filled with dynamic content through a clunky interface.
Security updates, software updates, server updates, php screw-ups... all of these things waste your time and effort.
They provide some cool features, to be sure, but how many of those cumbersome baked-in tools do you need when you have a good understanding of some command-line tools,
liquid (or mustache, or what have you) templating, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</p>
<p>The answer, as it turns out, is not that many. And that&#39;s why this blog is built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>,
a &quot;blog-aware&quot; tool for building static, templated blogs.</p>
<p>It might not be the pinnacle of programming prowess or design, but I like the simplicity of this set-up, and I hope that you do too.</p>
<p>Before I get to the set-up for this page, what features do we <em>really</em> need in a simple blog? Here&#39;s what I wanted, in order of importance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to write posts anywhere in simple text format. No internet connection? No big deal, as long as offline files can be written in a format that can be converted into posts later.</li>
<li>Static serving of data. Only one Apache server, no databases of former posts, no PHP.</li>
<li>An intuitive directory structure.</li>
<li>Simple templating and themes.</li>
<li>Customizeable post presentation (archives, breadcrumbs, previews, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s it. The first two points are especially key, since logging into a CMS dashboard can get really old, really fast.
It can get old almost as quickly as debugging php errors between a SQL database and front-end content. And so, we use Jekyll.</p>
<p>Jekyll is extremely simple to install, as long as you have a bit of familiarity with a terminal interface.
You&#39;ll need to be comfortable moving around the directories in your site using <code>cd</code> instead of clicking a folder icon.
But that&#39;s OK... using computers is just like reading. Leave the pretty pictures to the kids, because adults use words.
(See <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php">this incredibly useful site</a> for the source of that quote.)</p>
<p>Jekyll works by &quot;baking&quot; templates, HTML/CSS, scripts, and markdown files into a static presentation of your blog posts.
This baking can be done in any environment, but I&#39;ve taken a liking to the workflow provided by cloud-based IDEs like <a href="https://c9.io/">cloud9</a>.
As a sometimes-Chromebook-user, I like having access to a full linux server whenver I need it, but you can do all of this work
with jekyll on your own machine at home, too. In the case of this blog, all I had to do was fire up a terminal, <code>cd</code> into the <code>blog</code> sub-directory and enter:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ jekyll build
~ $ jekyll serve --port $PORT --host $IP
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This is also in the specific case of serving a Jekyll blog in a single sub-directory of a static site.
I could also have built the entire site using Jekyll and still served the static pages (e.g. &quot;about me&quot;),
but that seemed like overkill, since I would have to keep any locally-hosted previews running at all times if I wanted real-time updates.
Either way works, so I went with a bit of separation between blog and page.</p>
<p>Also of note: if you&#39;re running this site on a local machine instead of on a cloud-based environment or an external server,
then there&#39;s no need for the <code>--port $PORT --host $IP</code> bit, as those are Jekyll flags being used to pass in cloud9-specific variables.</p>
<p>The above commands (starting at <code>jekyll build</code>) will also only work if you have the correct <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">directory structure</a>,
with special importance given to the <code>_config.yml</code> file (see the docs on <code>_config</code> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/">here</a>). Take a look at the link on proper directory structure above.
You&#39;ll notice a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good &#39;ol <code>index.html</code> hanging out in the root directory. This will be the place where everything is smushed together and presented to the browser to display.</li>
<li>A lot of directories (and one file) with the naming format <code>_name</code> instead of just <code>name</code>. Anything without the underscore is included as-is in the final <code>_site</code> folder (more on that later), whereas anything with an underscore is just a component to be used to build the final <code>index.html</code> files at the bottom of every directory.</li>
<li>A mix of file extensions, from <code>*.txt</code> to <code>*.html</code> to <code>*.md</code> to <code>*.yml</code>. Jekyll takes all of these files and turns them into cool stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll save the meat of the explanation of how everything ties together for my next post on the tech behind the blog.
For right now, though, it&#39;s enough to know that all of the <code>_posts</code> files are written in Markdown format, saved in with a naming convention that excludes capital letters,
replaces spaces with hyphens, and includes the date in year-month-day- format at the beginning of the title, and that that information,
combined with some of the front-end matter (more on that in the next tech post) allows Jekyll to build the final output into an <code>index.html</code>
file that sits in a series of directories created according to the naming configuration outlined in <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>
<p>And after it&#39;s all said and done, and you&#39;ve run <code>jekyll build</code> on your final product, Jekyll spits out a <code>_site</code> folder.
That folder contains everything that needs to be uploaded via SSH or SFTP to the server.
With SFTP, all you have to do (once you&#39;ve figured out how to connect to your web host from the command line) is use
<code>put -r [directory or file]</code> on all of the contents of <code>_site</code>, and you&#39;re ready to go.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s an introduction to getting a static blog up and running using Jekyll. In the next post, we&#39;ll talk
about how the theming structure works and look a bit deeper into using Liquid Markup to create some of the neat blog
features that we might miss from traditional blogging frameworks.</p>

<div class="about-me hidden">
    <h4>My name is Alex, and I build things.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Maybe not kitchen tables or log cabins (not yet, anyway), but you'll always find me building <i>something</i>.
    Those somethings that I'm most proud of have been made-from-scratch businesses or programs. I take pride in creating organizations that are useful and meaningful (more on what that means later in <a href="http://alexpear.com/blog">my blog</a>).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The desire to build things has taken me a lot of places. The need to build has lead me to create teaching opportunities for musicians and artists, or help to turn a student-run nightclub into a successful event space, or create a place for unlikely athletes to meet their full potential, or build a program that helps aspiring programmers learn the skills that they need to change careers into full-time software development.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    That's the most important thing to know about me. Some other less important information:</p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Born in Dallas, TX, raised in Cedar Rapids, IA, educated in Northfield, MN, former resident and life-long fan of Nashville, TN.</li>
        <li>I currently live in St. Louis with my lady love and a dog that looks like a mix of Yoda, a Wampa, and a Siberian Husky.</li>
        <li>I was the founding Director of Curriculum, Instruction, and Outreach at <a href="http://claimacademystl.com">Claim Academy</a>, St. Louis's first developer bootcamp.</li>
        <li>Currently, I work as a freelance web developer and technology education consultant.</li>
        <li>I enjoy proper grammar and punctuation, and I'm a strong advocate for the Oxford comma.</li>
        <li>To hire me, <a href='mailto:alex@alexpear.com'>send me a message</a></li>
