##Barleycakes and Water and Weightlifting
###The importance of temperament on success and survival

Happiness is a tricky thing to pin down. Some folks will tell you happiness
happens at the extremes, in moments of indulgence.
Some folks will say that hedonism is fleeting,
and that real happiness comes from a sense of purpose.
Others wil say that new experiences are key, while others will say that routine is key.
It's almost like the term "happiness" is so vague that it ceases to be a terribly useful term.
Almost.

In general, though, my personal experiences lean towards happiness being tied to a sense of progress.
While, in the end, we're all dust on a tiny blue dot in an incomprehensively vast universe,
it's nice to at least feel that the universe has progressed or changed in some way because we were a part of it.
That's one of the things that motivates me to build,
in the hopes that at least some of the things I build end up being indelible
(*cue a re-read of **Ozymandius** by Percy Bysshe Shelley*).

All of that to say, that if happiness or life satisfaction is tied to progress,
we need to come up with a way of living that doesn't favor burning out (and/or fading away).
It's a marathon, not a sprint. A lifetime of sustained progress will tend to trump
a series of rocket flights (and subsequent crashes/explosions), if we're measuring total output
or progress over lifetimes. Think of meth addicts versus just about everyone else in the world.

This is so important for the starters of the world. The excitement of starting something new can
sometimes look to outsiders like the behavior of a junkie; days of elation and celebration
separated from crushing defeat and abject depression by a matter of hours or minutes.
Anyone that has ventured to change anything in their lives knows the hysteria of unexpected adversity
and the addictive high of victory. The most experienced builders know, though,
that both states are dangerous. Both states of being encourage reckless decisions and rash action.
The key, then, is to not ride the emotional rollercoaster. No matter the outcome of your actions
(which, make no mistake, *ought to be bold*), reactions should be tempered by the realization
that every extreme is probably a temporary deviation from a linear (and hopefully progressing) mean.
Let the fire in your belly be a well-tended bed of embers,
rather than a fire that consumes its fuel before providing any useful heat.

The impetus for these thoughts came from three sources: an ancient Greek philosopher with a carbohydrate-heavy diet,
a cabin in rural Alaska, and sweaty people in spandex. There will be another post
on the Alaskan Cabin Experience later, but we'll cover the intersection of weightlifting and philosophy in this post.
I promise that it will be loads of fun, and I promise that all of these things
apply to our discussion of the temprament towards progress (and, thus, happiness).
The coolest ideas happen at the interface!

The first influence that introduced me to the idea of steady progress over wild swings
lived and died a few centuries before us. Epicurus, who's always been mis-quoted as
an advocate for a life of indulgence and transient delights,
gave us a pretty clear set of ideals at the entrance to his gathering place
for would-be philosophers
(in a time when "philosophy" was a proving ground for those wanting to start something new):

> The hospitable keeper of this mansion,
where you will find pleasure the highest good,
will present you liberally with barley cakes, and water from the spring.
These gardens will not provoke your appetite by artificial dainties,
but satisfy it with natural supplies.
Will you not then be well entertained?

Here poor chaps might have come across the Epicurean "mansion" with hopes of bacchanalean pleasure,
only to find that the head honcho thought that entertainment came from a calm, cool, collected demeanor
and the pursuit of higher questions of the Age. While I'm not one to advocate for barley cakes,
it's a good lesson for starters that maybe these wild swings of emotion (both high and low)
are just distractions from the pursuits that got us interested in starting something new in the first place.
Epicurus's solution was to get rid of as many distractions as possible,
which is not a lifestyle that I'm about to adopt all of the time,
but I think he has the right idea of true progress being hindered by a junkie's rush/crash cycle.
So how do we find our own "barley cakes and water" attitude in the midst of focused pursuit?

The best practice I've ever had for this attitude came from coaching competitive weightlifters.
There's something incredibly addicting to the rush one feels when you conquer an inanimate object,
whose only purpose is to be heavy, and whose only defeat comes by being thrown into the air.
In the world of weightlifting, as in the world of starting and building new things,
the obstacle (in this case, a barbell) wins more often than not.
And it can be an emotional rollercoaster in much the same way... a personal best and new gym record
on one day, and a season-ending injury on the next.
There are constant moments of self-doubt and occasional moments of untouchable confidence.

Some folks have the strategy of getting hyped up before big lifts, of getting as "amped" as possible.
Those same folks will also have the hardest falls when they get beaten by a big weight.
Most will throw temper-tantrums or fall into a depressed state.
Among the hype-beasts, the best recover quickly from this state.
And some of them can get to be pretty good lifters. But *none* of them get to be the world's best,
and I would wager that few are happy with their progress.
Compare this to the champion weightlifter, who's competed for decades.
Not only are they more consistent, but they're generally more reserved in all gym-related things.
Set a new back squat record for the gym? A genuine smile, a small wave of thanks to the Coach,
and a pat on the back from a teammate are all that's needed.
A disastrous lift on the international stage? A chin held high,
a quick adjustment from the Coach, and a cool drink of water are all that's needed.

It takes some getting used to, for sure.
But the idea of progress in the long haul depends on a temprament that understands that
"this, too, shall pass" and that the solid and dependable will often be happier
than the frenetic and exciteable, simply by virtue of their sustained progress.
