##Specialization is for Insects##
####...or, how to be a wide pool with some clusters of depth

One of my favorite authors of all time is, believe it or not, the source for one of my favorite quotes of all time.
It's something of a life motto for me by this point, 
and any self-described starter (or any human being, as the quote would suggest) 
in danger of being pigeon-holed would do well to check out Robert A. Heinlein's view of specialization:

>A human being should be able to change a diaper,
>plan an invasion, 
>butcher a hog, 
>conn a ship,
>design a building, 
>write a sonnet, 
>balance accounts, 
>build a wall, 
>set a bone, 
>comfort the dying, 
>take orders, 
>give orders, 
>cooperate, 
>act alone, 
>solve equations, 
>analyze a new problem, 
>pitch manure, 
>program a computer, 
>cook a tasty meal, 
>fight efficiently, 
>die gallantly. 
>**Specialization is for insects.**

This might be a bit of a species-ist view,
especially considering that [bugs and insects dwarf mammals on this planet in terms of biomass](http://www.si.edu/encyclopedia_si/nmnh/buginfo/bugnos.htm).
But that's neither here nor there. Bugs aren't really known for their exploits in literature or entrepreneurship,
so we might be able to safely assume that they inhabit a different world than us sapiens
(even if we occupy the same planet).
