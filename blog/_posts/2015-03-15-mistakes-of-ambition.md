##Mistakes of Ambition vs Mistakes of Sloth

It's fitting that the post that I finish on the Ides of March happens to be about decision-making,
leadership, and how to make mistakes. Please do not assume that I'm advocating for the kind of leadership
that calls for stabbings on the steps of the Senate, Roman or otherwise.
But trust me, it's an interesting topic: how do we make decisions, and what kind of decisions give us the best chance of success?

The point I'm going to make is that the *kind* of decisions that you make (and their follow-through),
are almost as important as the decision itself. Not that you won't screw up,
and certainly not that you should make decisions of any import lightly,
but to encourage you to let both your mistakes and victories be grand, ambitious, and clear.

To segue into the point: one of the most interesting facts about leadership under pressure
comes from studies of shipwrecks, plane crashes, and other scenarios of stranded teams
operating without full information. [Here's a great little article comparing
two different shipwrecks on the same island, for roughly the same duration,
at the same time, and two wildly different outcomes](http://wildernessinnovation.com/2012/01/12/leadership-is-essential-for-group-survival/).
The rate of survival for these small teams depends less
on the quality of decisions made then the ability of the leader to stand behind those decisions,
present a clear vision of success, and get everyone on board with a solution.
This applied even when the "solution" wasn't technically correct or the best option,
as long as the leadership was willing to [adapt quickly](http://alexpear.com/blog//2015/01/29/specialization-is-for-insects/)
when failures (mistakes of ambition) happened. Interesting, huh?

This is *not* to say that the decisions made were decisions made in a vacuum.
Decisions to set sail vs stay put, or to ford the river vs head upstream,
are all decisions that are understandable without the benefit of hindsight.
And some of these decisions lead directly to disaster, 
and those of us hanging out in the future can look back with a little bit of aloofness and say
"if only they had done *x*, they would have been fine." 
But the odds are better than failing to make a decision at all, in every case.
One case relies on luck for survival, the other on concentrated effort with incomplete information.

So how does this apply to you, the hopefully-not-shipwrecked reader?
I think there are lessons to learn for those of us that are looking to start something new,
which can sometimes feel like being stranded at sea. We're bound to make mistakes,
but the biggest mistake of all is indecision. 
Political Scientist #1 Nick Machiavelli puts it in better terms:

>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible),
>but calculating risk and acting decisively. 
>**Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth**.
>Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.

For starters, this is the best advice about leadership I've ever read.
Gather your data, make your decision, throw your weight behind that decision, and GO.
Sometimes your data is incomplete or your analysis is flawed, which might mean that you fail. 
More often, it means that you can quickly reasses the situation and make a new ambitious decision.
The odds are high that you'll make a mistake of ambition.
But those mistakes are usually far preferable to the mistake of inaction, indecision, or waffling.
