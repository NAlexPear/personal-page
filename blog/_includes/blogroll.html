<h3>Tech Skills For The Modern Entrepreneur</h3><div class="date">01/25/2016</div><p>A recent trend in the world of outdoor adventuring is the idea of <a href="http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ultralight-backpacking.html">Ultralight Backpacking</a>. It&#39;s the art of venturing into the unknown with the barest of essentials, maximizing the usefulness of every piece of one&#39;s kit, and creatively adapting to situations as they arrive rather than packing a cumbersome or </p><br><h3>Workflow 1 The Past</h3><div class="date">06/30/2015</div><p>It used to be (in what some <em>might</em> be tempted to call the Good &#39;Ol Days) that all it took to start developing for the web was an <code>index.html</code> file. Then we started getting fancy: maybe we need a separate stylesheet, how about some external JavaScript, maybe some extra assets... and then things got complex. Not bad, by any means, just more complex.

This jives nicely with my own needs as a small (but growing!) blog, totally customize</p><br><h3>Learn To Be Useful</h3><div class="date">04/30/2015</div><p>An English Lit teacher of mine once told me that every great essay started with a contentious statement. So here goes mine:<br>

But I still remember the slogan, thanks t</p><br><h3>On Trust</h3><div class="date">04/14/2015</div><p>Trust is tricky. Whether it&#39;s an organization, an individual, or an abstract system,
trust is usually seen as something that&#39;s valuable, but difficult to measure.
As individuals, we often say we want to be trusted, but tend to shirk the responsibilities
required by trust. So we want to be trusted, without any of the baggage associated with that trust.
I usually talk about trust in an or</p><br><h3>Mistakes Of Ambition</h3><div class="date">03/15/2015</div><p>It&#39;s fitting that the post that I finish on the Ides of March happens to be about decision-making,
leadership, and how to make mistakes. Please do not assume that I&#39;m advocating for the kind of leadership
that calls for stabbings on the steps of the Senate, Roman or otherwise.
But trust me, it&#39;s an interesting topic: how do we make decisions, and what kind of decisions give us the b</p><br><h3>Barleycakes And Water And Weightlifting</h3><div class="date">02/16/2015</div><p>Happiness is a tricky thing to pin down. Some folks will tell you happiness
happens at the extremes, in moments of indulgence.
Some folks will say that hedonism is fleeting,
and that real happiness comes from a sense of purpose.
Others will say that new experiences are key, while others will say that routine is key.
It&#39;s almost like the term &quot;happiness&quot; is so vague that it ceases </p><br><h3>Specialization Is For Insects</h3><div class="date">01/29/2015</div><p>One of my favorite authors of all time is, believe it or not, the source for one of my favorite quotes of all time.
It&#39;s something of a life motto for me by this point,
and any self-described starter (or any human being, as the quote would suggest)
in danger of being pigeon-holed would do well to check out Robert A. Heinlein&#39;s view of specialization:</p>

but <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong?language=en">here&#39;s another one anyway</a>.
This talk is worth watching or reading, from start to finish.
I think Dan makes two great points in this talk that apply not just to non-profits,
and not just to businesses, but to any endeavor worth d</p><br><h3>Blog Tech 1</h3><div class="date">12/03/2014</div><p>While most of my posts will deal with more abstract &quot;builds&quot; (businesses, processes, campaigns),
this one is more of a how-to on building a blog like this one. This blog is not a WordPress or Drupal site.
Those CMSes are nice, as long as you like managing a server filled with dynamic content through a clunky interface.
Security updates, software updates, server updates, php screw-ups.</p><br><h3>Starting From Scratch</h3><div class="date">11/12/2014</div><p>They say that breaking up is hard to do, but it&#39;s not nearly as difficult as getting something started in the first place.
Breakups usually have some momentum behind them already. Some are even inevitable to outside observers.
Starting something new, regardless of the undertaking, is almost always viewed with skepticism from external sources
and doubt or hesitation internally. Whether you&#</p><br><h3>Getting Started</h3><div class="date">10/15/2014</div><p>While there&#39;s quite a lot to say about the process of getting started (in big things or little things in life... more thoughts on that in a later post),
this post is more about what I hope to accomplish with this blog over the next few hundred (thousand?) posts. Realistically, I have the following three goals for this space:</p>
