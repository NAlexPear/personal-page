###Hi there,

This is a repo containing the guts of my (Alex Pearson's) personal webpage. I use git for version control even when I'm working on solo projects, so it may as well be on GitHub and open-sourced, right? 

Take what you'd like from anything I've written here, as long as you promise not to judge too harshly if you find something out-of-whack. This is always the beta-build of the site... working versions can be found, of course, at http://alexpear.com. 

Thanks for stopping by!

-Alex
