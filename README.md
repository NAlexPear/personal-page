## Hi there

This is a repo containing the guts of my (Alex Pearson's) personal webpage.

Take what you'd like from anything I've written here, as long as you promise not to judge too harshly if you find something out-of-whack. This is always the beta-build of the site... working versions can be found, of course, at https://alexpear.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
