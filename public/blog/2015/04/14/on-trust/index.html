            <p>##On Trust##<br />
####Building a machine that needs tuning, not driving####</p>

<p>Trust is tricky. Whether it’s an organization, an individual, or an abstract system,<br />
trust is usually seen as something that’s valuable, but difficult to measure.<br />
As individuals, we often say we want to be trusted, but tend to shirk the responsibilities<br />
required by trust. So we want to be trusted, without any of the baggage associated with that trust.<br />
I usually talk about trust in an organization as a kind of distributed leadership,<br />
where every leader is a subject-matter expert responsible for those systems under their control.<br />
This kind of trust is fairly measurable; if leaders are accomplishing the tasks to which<br />
they’ve been entrusted, then everything is on the right track.<br />
The trustworthiness of these leaders is measurable as a percentage of the assigned tasks that<br />
they complete themselves or successfully delegate. No sweat.</p>

<p>There’s another kind of trust that’s a bit more insidious, though, especially in young,<br />
tight-knit-by-necessity organizations. This kind of trust is more than simply<br />
distributed leadership. It’s more than a checklist of responsibilities.<br />
And I submit that it’s the more important of the two types of trust. <br />
This kind of trust is the certainty that <strong>the goals of everyone involved end up at the same place.</strong></p>

<p>This is an extremely difficult kind of trust to enforce. <br />
Instead, it must be found, fostered, and focused by those in positions of leadership.<br />
Further, it must be an absolutely conscious choice on the part of every individual in an organization<br />
to ascribe to this kind of trust. Invariably, this kind of trust breaks down in all but the most<br />
tightly-run organizations (which might be the opposite of what you expect), <br />
but it’s worth the effort.</p>

<p>When this kind of trust permeates an organization’s culture,<br />
the cost of maintaining oversight over individual employees becomes negligible. <br />
The output from employees (if you’ve hired the right kind of employees) increases.<br />
Team members are more comfortable trying new things and spending more time on projects. <br />
And, if maintained correctly, team members know that they are valuable to the company,<br />
and feel like the company maintains their best interests at all times.<br />
It’s a beautiful thing when it works. So how do you foster this kind of culture?</p>

<p><em>1) You need a plan</em></p>

<p>I won’t call it a “vision” like many people like to. Visions are like ideas and bellybuttons:<br />
everyone has one, and they aren’t particularly useful. As a reader of this blog,<br />
you probably already know that. There’s a big difference between the guy with an <br />
idea for product or a vision of a company and the guy with a prototype or a plan.<br />
If you want people to adjust their goals towards yours,<br />
you need to have a plan (with measurable results) that’s worth following.</p>

<p><em>2) You need to find people that are excited in your plan</em></p>

<p>The most important part of the hiring or team-building process is figuring out the kind of person<br />
that truly <strong>gets it</strong>. This is much easier said than done, of course. <br />
The art of feigning interest in an idea is an important step of the interview process<br />
for many people looking for employment or a job (rather than a project or a passion). <br />
You want the former, not the latter, 100% of the time. There’s no perfect way to assess this,<br />
and only shrewdness honed by experience will give you an eye and an ear for the fakers,<br />
but there are a couple of signs that someone cares about what you’re doing rather than<br />
the paycheck associated with what you’re doing. If they really care, they’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask lots of questions about what pain points your organization stuggles with.</li>
  <li>Listen to the answers to the above questions.</li>
  <li>Offer their own solutions to the pain points above.</li>
  <li>Synthesize your organizations objectives with past experience (bonus points if you hadn’t thought of those intersections before)</li>
  <li>Never mention their own life sitution in the context of “needing” a job.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the big ones that I look for. Folks that focus on the successes of an organization<br />
are usually just sucking up. Folks that talk over your responses are usually trying to sell you<br />
on their enthusiasm, when you should be looking for individuals that focus their energies<br />
on productive solutions to the obstacles to your master plan.<br />
And folks looking for a “job” aren’t the ones interested in executing any more of your plan<br />
than is required to avoid being fired (assuming you’re offering them a traditional job at all).<br />
Find the person that’s as big an advocate for your plan as you are,<br />
and never let them go!</p>

<p><em>3) You need to maintain clear expectations at a high level</em></p>

<p>The truly worthwhile plan doesn’t work if you can’t delegate it. <br />
And you can’t delegate if you’re involved in the daily minutiae.<br />
If you’ve hired the right people and built the right kind of plan,<br />
you should be able to rest easy in the idea that if you were to leave tomorrow without prior notice,<br />
everyone would be ready to fill in whatever gaps are left in the line rather than<br />
metaphorically about-face and head for the hills.<br />
The machine shouldn’t need weekly status meetings to maintain the right general direction.<br />
This is not to say that you shouldn’t check for task completion.<br />
Rather, this is the trust that if you gave no tasks at all, or no specific instructions<br />
on a given day, your team mates would still come up with something to do that furthered your<br />
plan in a general sense. This doesn’t mean that you should rely on this all of the time,<br />
as your contribution to the plan is, most likely, specific feedback and direction on many<br />
of the daily activities that team members undergo. But your role should always be one<br />
of assistance and cultivation rather than enforcement or draconian oversight.<br />
If you don’t think that’s possible, you’re either a micromanager,<br />
you haven’t properly communicated your high-level plan, or you’ve hired the wrong people.</p>

<p><em>4) Fire quickly</em></p>

<p>When dealing with people, it’s always best to assume that you’re on the same team.<br />
That their failures are lapses or misunderstandings rather than a deep<br />
character flaw or fundamental inability to comprehend. In some large companies<br />
or toxic organizations, you might have to step around those whose behavior<br />
are at odds with the plan, or who might be fundamentally incapable of certain things.<br />
The starter doesn’t have that luxury. The instant you find yourself not trusting<br />
that someone has the best interest of the company at heart, it’s best to get rid of that person.<br />
The instant you begin to think that someone wasn’t really sick on their sick day,<br />
or that their lunch break might have been an interview with another company,<br />
rather than a legitimate request or needed downtime, you’re wasting your energy on things<br />
that should be left to trust. Either you’re micromanaging, and you should let it go,<br />
or your team mate isn’t worthy of trust, and you should let them go.<br />
There are no other options that are viable in the long term.</p>

<p>It’s not an easy thing to do, and I’ve made this mistake (as both the hired and the hiring manager)<br />
more times than I would like to admit. Like a frog in boiling water,<br />
this kind of mistrust builds up to pervade a culture in such insidious ways, <br />
and can ruin the sort of atmosphere of excellence that has to be cultivated in<br />
a high-performance team. Hire slowly, fire quickly, and do it all with a fair dose of humility.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do these four things, and you’ll be well on your way to having a team that trusts each other.<br />
Don’t waste your time with teams that aren’t built around these principles,<br />
and fight tooth and nail to protect those that are, and you’ll suddenly find<br />
that more and more of your ventures become something lasting (instead of something implosive).</p>
