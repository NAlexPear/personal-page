            <p>##Mistakes of Ambition vs Mistakes of Sloth</p>

<p>It’s fitting that the post that I finish on the Ides of March happens to be about decision-making,<br />
leadership, and how to make mistakes. Please do not assume that I’m advocating for the kind of leadership<br />
that calls for stabbings on the steps of the Senate, Roman or otherwise.<br />
But trust me, it’s an interesting topic: how do we make decisions, and what kind of decisions give us the best chance of success?</p>

<p>The point I’m going to make is that the <em>kind</em> of decisions that you make (and their follow-through),<br />
are almost as important as the decision itself. Not that you won’t screw up,<br />
and certainly not that you should make decisions of any import lightly,<br />
but to encourage you to let both your mistakes and victories be grand, ambitious, and clear.</p>

<p>To segue into the point: one of the most interesting facts about leadership under pressure<br />
comes from studies of shipwrecks, plane crashes, and other scenarios of stranded teams<br />
operating without full information. <a href="http://wildernessinnovation.com/2012/01/12/leadership-is-essential-for-group-survival/">Here’s a great little article comparing<br />
two different shipwrecks on the same island, for roughly the same duration,<br />
at the same time, and two wildly different outcomes</a>.<br />
The rate of survival for these small teams depends less<br />
on the quality of decisions made by their captain than the ability of the leader to stand behind those decisions,<br />
present a clear vision of success, and get everyone on board with a solution.<br />
This applied even when the “solution” wasn’t technically correct or the best option,<br />
as long as the leadership was willing to <a href="http://alexpear.com/blog//2015/01/29/specialization-is-for-insects/">adapt quickly</a><br />
when failures (mistakes of ambition) happened. Interesting, huh?</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> to say that the decisions made were decisions made in a vacuum.<br />
Decisions to set sail vs stay put, or to ford the river vs head upstream,<br />
are all decisions that are understandable without the benefit of hindsight.<br />
And some of these decisions lead directly to disaster, <br />
and those of us hanging out in the future can look back with a little bit of aloofness and say<br />
“if only they had done <em>x</em>, they would have been fine.” <br />
But the odds are better than failing to make a decision at all, in every case.<br />
One case relies on luck for survival, the other on concentrated effort with incomplete information.</p>

<p>So how does this apply to you, the hopefully-not-shipwrecked reader?<br />
I think there are lessons to learn for those of us that are looking to start something new,<br />
which can sometimes feel like being stranded at sea. We’re bound to make mistakes,<br />
but the biggest mistake of all is indecision. <br />
Political Scientist #1 Nick Machiavelli puts it in better terms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible),<br />
but calculating risk and acting decisively. <br />
<strong>Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth</strong>.<br />
Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, this is the best advice about leadership I’ve ever read.<br />
Gather your data, make your decision, throw your weight behind that decision, and GO.<br />
Sometimes your data is incomplete or your analysis is flawed, which might mean that you fail. <br />
More often, it means that you can quickly reasses the situation and make a new ambitious decision.<br />
The odds are high that you’ll make a mistake of ambition.<br />
But those mistakes are usually far preferable to the mistake of inaction, indecision, or waffling.</p>
