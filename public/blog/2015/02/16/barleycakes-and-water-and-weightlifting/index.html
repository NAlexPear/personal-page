            <p>##Barleycakes and Water and Weightlifting<br />
####The importance of temprament on success and survival</p>

<p>Happiness is a tricky thing to pin down. Some folks will tell you happiness<br />
happens at the extremes, in moments of indulgence.<br />
Some folks will say that hedonism is fleeting, <br />
and that real happiness comes from a sense of purpose. <br />
Others wil say that new experiences are key, while others will say that routine is key.<br />
It’s almost like the term “happiness” is so vague that it ceases to be a terribly useful term.<br />
Almost.</p>

<p>In general, though, my personal experiences lean towards happiness being tied to a sense of progress.<br />
While, in the end, we’re all dust on a tiny blue dot in an incomprehensively vast universe,<br />
it’s nice to at least feel that the universe has progressed or changed in some way because we were a part of it. <br />
That’s one of the things that motivates me to build,<br />
in the hopes that at least some of the things I build end up being indelible<br />
(<em>cue a re-read of <strong>Ozymandius</strong> by Percy Bysshe Shelley</em>).</p>

<p>All of that to say, that if happiness or life satisfaction is tied to progress,<br />
we need to come up with a way of living that doesn’t favor burning out (and/or fading away).<br />
It’s a marathon, not a sprint. A lifetime of sustained progress will tend to trump<br />
a series of rocket flights (and subsequent crashes/explosions), if we’re measuring total output<br />
or progress over lifetimes. Think of meth addicts versus just about everyone else in the world.</p>

<p>This is so important for the starters of the world. The excitement of starting something new can<br />
sometimes look to outsiders like the behavior of a junkie; days of elation and celebration<br />
separated from crushing defeat and abject depression by a matter of hours or minutes.<br />
Anyone that has ventured to change anything in their lives knows the hysteria of unexpected adversity<br />
and the addictive high of victory. The most experienced builders know, though,<br />
that both states are dangerous. Both states of being encourage reckless decisions and rash action.<br />
The key, then, is to not ride the emotional rollercoaster. No matter the outcome of your actions<br />
(which, make no mistake, <em>ought to be bold</em>), reactions should be tempered by the realization<br />
that every extreme is probably a temporary deviation from a linear (and hopefully progressing) mean. <br />
Let the fire in your belly be a well-tended bed of embers,<br />
rather than a fire that consumes its fuel before providing any useful heat.</p>

<p>The impetus for these thoughts came from three sources: an ancient Greek philosopher with a carbohydrate-heavy diet,<br />
a cabin in rural Alaska, and sweaty people in spandex. There will be another post<br />
on the Alaskan Cabin Experience later, but we’ll cover the intersection of weightlifting and philosophy in this post.<br />
I promise that it will be loads of fun, and I promise that all of these things<br />
apply to our discussion of the temprament towards progress (and, thus, happiness).<br />
The coolest ideas happen at the interface!</p>

<p>The first influence that introduced me to the idea of steady progress over wild swings<br />
lived and died a few centuries before us. Epicurus, who’s always been mis-quoted as<br />
an advocate for a life of indulgence and transient delights,<br />
gave us a pretty clear set of ideals at the entrance to his gathering place<br />
for would-be philosophers <br />
(in a time when “philosophy” was a proving ground for those wanting to start something new):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hospitable keeper of this mansion,<br />
where you will find pleasure the highest good,<br />
will present you liberally with barley cakes, and water from the spring.<br />
These gardens will not provoke your appetite by artificial dainties,<br />
but satisfy it with natural supplies.<br />
Will you not then be well entertained?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here poor chaps might have come across the Epicurean “mansion” with hopes of bacchanalean pleasure,<br />
only to find that the head honcho thought that entertainment came from a calm, cool, collected demeanor<br />
and the pursuit of higher questions of the Age. While I’m not one to advocate for barley cakes,<br />
it’s a good lesson for starters that maybe these wild swings of emotion (both high and low)<br />
are just distractions from the pursuits that got us interested in starting something new in the first place.<br />
Epicurus’s solution was to get rid of as many distractions as possible,<br />
which is not a lifestyle that I’m about to adopt all of the time,<br />
but I think he has the right idea of true progress being hindered by a junkie’s rush/crash cycle.<br />
So how do we find our own “barley cakes and water” attitude in the midst of focused pursuit?</p>

<p>The best practice I’ve ever had for this attitude came from coaching competitive weightlifters.<br />
There’s something incredibly addicting to the rush one feels when you conquer an inanimate object,<br />
whose only purpose is to be heavy, and whose only defeat comes by being thrown into the air.<br />
In the world of weightlifting, as in the world of starting and building new things,<br />
the obstacle (in this case, a barbell) wins more often than not. <br />
And it can be an emotional rollercoaster in much the same way… a personal best and new gym record<br />
on one day, and a season-ending injury on the next.<br />
There are constant moments of self-doubt and occasional moments of untouchable confidence.</p>

<p>Some folks have the strategy of getting hyped up before big lifts, of getting as “amped” as possible.<br />
Those same folks will also have the hardest falls when they get beaten by a big weight. <br />
Most will throw temper-tantrums or fall into a depressed state.<br />
Among the hype-beasts, the best recover quickly from this state.<br />
And some of them can get to be pretty good lifters. But <em>none</em> of them get to be the world’s best,<br />
and I would wager that few are happy with their progress. <br />
Compare this to the champion weightlifter, who’s competed for decades.<br />
Not only are they more consistent, but they’re generally more reserved in all gym-related things.<br />
Set a new back squat record for the gym? A genuine smile, a small wave of thanks to the Coach,<br />
and a pat on the back from a teammate are all that’s needed.<br />
A disastrous lift on the international stage? A chin held high,<br />
a quick adjustment from the Coach, and a cool drink of water are all that’s needed.</p>

<p>It takes some getting used to, for sure. <br />
But the idea of progress in the long haul depends on a temprament that understands that<br />
“this, too, shall pass” and that the solid and dependable will often be happier<br />
than the frenetic and exciteable, simply by virtue of their sustained progress.</p>
