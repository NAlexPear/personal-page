            <h2>Thanks for visiting my blog</h2>

<p>While there's quite a lot to say about the process of getting started (in big things or little things in life... more thoughts on that in a later post),
this post is more about what I hope to accomplish with this blog over the next few hundred (thousand?) posts. Realistically, I have the following three goals for this space:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to get better at writing. This blog will have a personal feel to it, because I want it to, but I'd like to think that the simple act of typing out my thoughts will lead to a better understanding of the craft of writing in both professional and personal applications.</li>
<li>I'd like to have fun. Again, totally self-centered motivations, but that seems like a realistic goal.</li>
<li>I'd like to get better at organizing and presenting my thoughts on complex issues, and I find that writing with a goal in mind helps to organize those thoughts.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those goals are mostly self-directed, and that's ok. But I'm glad that you're here, too, so here are some goals that depend a bit more upon you, the reader:</p>

<ul>
<li>I hope that you can learn something practical or useful that you can use in your daily life.</li>
<li>I hope that you can come to a more complete understanding of some subject, even if I don't directly broach that subject in these posts. I've found that a lot of the material that prompts these posts comes from sources outside the typically thought-of realm of good, solid information or no-nonsense tutorial. Hopefully, that adds value rather than distraction.</li>
<li>I hope you catch all of my spelling and grammar errors and email me (at alex@alexpear.com) before telling your friends.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of those are, I think, realistic goals. My more ambitious goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to spark conversation on topics that extend beyond the scope of individual posts (reminder to self: implement comment sections)</li>
<li>I'd like to consistently provide real value to the readers of this blog</li>
<li>I'd like to have "readers" plural (once the site is a bit more polished, perhaps)</li>
<li>I'd like to have perfect spelling and grammar on every post (this one might already have gone out the window).</li>
</ul>


<p>These goals aren't exactly textbook in format (realistic, measurable, meaningful, and time-sensitive), but I hope that they've communicated to you my intentions for this space. Either way, let's figure it out together.</p>
