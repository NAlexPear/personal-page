            <p>##Getting Started<br />
###…and why it sucks</p>

<p>They say that breaking up is hard to do, but it’s not nearly as difficult as getting something started in the first place.<br />
Breakups usually have some momentum behind them already. Some are even inevitable to outside observers. <br />
Starting something new, regardless of the undertaking, is almost always viewed with skepticism from external sources<br />
and doubt or hesitation internally. Whether you’re going back to school, starting a business, beginning a new fitness regimen<br />
(especially one that includes squats, sweat, and actual work), or moving to a new city, starting is scary.</p>

<p>And there are some very good reasons for this. Deep-seated reasons for the hesitation to actually <em>start</em>.<br />
Besides our baseline Neolithic aversion to anything different or out-of-the-ordinary,<br />
starters have to fight through a whole host of psychological quirks and roadblocks that make the modern man (or woman) so bad at getting started.<br />
(WARNING: TED talk + Wikipedia links ahead)<br />
It might be because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD440CY2Vs0">we’re afraid of failure</a> in the deeply animalian part of our brain.<br />
It might be because <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en">the gratification from sharing goals is sufficient to offset the stress induced by deadlines on those same goals</a>.<br />
It might be because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">we’ve failed to internalize the rewards from previous starts, and we consider ourselves imposters</a><br />
among our current or future peers. <br />
There’s no lack of reasons for a lack of starting.</p>

<p>But what do we do about it? Should we care? I think we <em>should</em> care when people us tell us we’re crazy,<br />
and we <em>should</em> listen carefully to their objections.<br />
But those objections should <em>not</em> be internalized as reasons not to do a thing. <br />
Rather, they should be seen as a product of due dilligence:<br />
every objection you face from folks at the start ought to have a response that you (and only you) find satisfactory. <br />
Eventually, your responses to these objections will become the selling points to get your butt off of the couch and into the fray.<br />
And your responses to these objections might only be satisfactory to you, according to your individual priorities. <br />
And that’s OK at the start.</p>

<p>We’ll certainly talk more about how to measure success once you’re up-and-running, and external validation will play a key role in that.<br />
But when you’re getting started on something, the hardest battle to fight is internal. <br />
Then you can deal with the haters.</p>
